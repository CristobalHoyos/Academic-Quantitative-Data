The dataset comes from an experiment made by psychologists whilst teaching their class and using two different methods and comparing the students' performance. The file did not have a dictionary so some columns are not hard to understand but most of them are decoded already and straightforward. I chose the data set because GPA has been a statistic that I had been studying and interpreting for the last year when doing my college research and tracking my own personal progress during the school year. It's a statistic that I could personally relate to and therefore interpret and understand its importance. The column that I chose is the students Current GPA and I calculated its mean: 2.90 and median: 3,00 although there is a significant standard deviation of: 0.76 considering that numbers wont go over 4.00, this standard deviation is large meaning that the data recorded is widely spread out. Personally I expected the mean and median to be higher but the standard deviation shows that there might be many outliers potentially that might be making the calculate averages innacurate.
